# SU-N-Inflation

Here I add codes (in their different versions) that I used to do my Masters research (repositorio unicamp). I have used Mathematica v 10.4 and 11.0.

Abstract: 
We show that several ingredients crucial to the Standard Cosmological Model, such as Inflation
and Dark Matter, could have a common origin in a Yang-Mills theory decoupled from the
Standard Model of Particle Physics. Several aspects of finite temperature Yang-Mills theory,
in particular the non-trivial behavior of bulk viscosity with temperature, have the potential to
provide a candidate for dark matter, in the form of glueball particles, and to generate Inflation
with a deconfinement transition.
In this thesis, we solve the Friedmann equations using the SU(N_c) Yang-Mills equation of
state and conjectured bulk viscosity behaviour, with generic conformal symmetry breaking
parameter and number of colors. We calculate the number of efoldings generated in the scenarios
investigated and we check the existence of a smooth transition at the end of the Inflationary
period. A viable case is detailed.
